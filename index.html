        I grew up riding dirtbikes and four-wheelers and had
 a pretty clear path set out to become a mechanic.
 My school had an auto shop where I completed over 
 900 CO-OP hours. After seeing how much the job
 can damage your body with time. I started looking 
 at different options. My mother's college recommended
 this course, and here I am.
